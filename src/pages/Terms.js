      <p>
        <b>Arbitration</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between
        them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any
        provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in
        equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be
        resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal
        Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and
        administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar
        arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually
        agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator’s award shall be final, and
        judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the
        event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration
        arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing
        party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney’s
        fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards
        to these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of
        these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, including
        Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties
        agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
        enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope
        and enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by
        the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination
        of these Terms and Conditions.

      <p>
        <b>Class Action Waiver</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an
        individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective
        actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING
        CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS
        A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR
        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY
        GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Ad Agency
        Creatives agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
        one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
